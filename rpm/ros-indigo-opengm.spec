%description
This package wraps the external c++ library opengm in a ROS package, so other
packages can use it. It downloads the source code of it and then unzips it. The
library is a header-only library with command line interfaces, which aren't
used, so it doesn't gets build. For further descriptions and tutorials see the
Makefile.tarball and https://github.com/opengm/opengm . Copyright (C) 2013
